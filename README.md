Library for reading/writing file types from the Diesel Engine

I may do some bits here and there in the future. Feel free to fork this repo or make Pull Requests. Code style is kinda all over the place, but I would prefer keeping it to CamelCase.

# Supported File Types

| font | x (BMFont & binary) | x |
| banksinfo | x | |

# Credits

A lot of the code is based on work by Zwagoth and I am not a spy..., much of the code has been changed a lot, but it would have been a lot harder without their work that can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/zabb65/payday-2-modding-information)
